# Dice-challenge
This is a really quick and simple website  designed to generate random dice value when we refresh our website. The dice get thrown randomly,
so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values, and the website will announce a winner depending on whose dice valuewas higher.
This will be a really neat website and you can use this website to settle arguments and any sort of disputes just by logging on to the website 
and trying to figure out who won.
